* Introduction

This paper:
 - covers /entity search/ problem,
 - formulates the framework and
 - _focus on *ranking entities*, particularly_ --- combining global aggregation, local analysis and result verification

Contribution:
 - formulate the characteristics and requirements of entity search
 - propose *Impression Model* and develop *EntityRank* scheme for entity ranking
 - evaluate the prototype on 2TB Web corpus

* Challenge

Entity search is 
 - contextual (matching by surrounding context),
 - holistic (across multiple occurance over different pages), 
 - uncertain, 
 - associative (tell true association from accidental) and 
 - discriminative (emphasize popular source pages).

Entity ranking is the centric issue.

** Framework

- Given :: A collection of entities $E=\{E_1,E_2,\cdots, E_N\}$ --- *tagged Web corpus*
- Input :: A query $\beta -\alpha(K_1,K_2,\cdots, K_l,E_1,E_2,\cdots,E_m)$, composed of 
 + a sequence of keywords $K_i$ and entities $E_j$ 
 + the matching pattern $\alpha$ /e.g./ $\mathtt{ow}$ order-window
 + the score measure $\beta$ for the ranks of the matching instances
- Output :: A list of tuples ranked by matching scores


The duplicated parts with /CIDR2007_EntitySearchEngine/ are omitted. 

** Requirements for Entity Ranking
 - R-Contextual
  + pattern --- order or bias towards specific sequence pattern, /e.g./ Amazon 1-800-201-7575 eBay
  + proximity --- the closer the keywords and the entity instances, the higher the probability
 - R-Holistic --- aggregate all the occurances for association probability estimation
 - R-Uncertainty --- extraction confidence probability must be captured
 - R-Associative --- purify the association
 - R-Discriminative --- popular pages should contribute more

* Impression Model - conceptual design

Ideally visit each documents and collect all the evidence, store all the judgement (impression) and stop when sufficient impression is acquired.

- access layer ::
at time $\tau$, the observer accesses a document $d^\tau$ from corpus $D$, until statistical mean of the impressions will converge (impression stablizes)

- recognition layer ::
assess if any potential tuple $t$ occurs with association probability $p(q(t)|d^\tau)$, where $q(t)$ denotes a query tuple matching formed by tuple $t$

Thus the final score is 
$Score(q(t)) = p(q(t)|D)$. (sufficient trial + sum = the whole corpus D)

Naive materialization: equally view every document + use co-occurance frequency of entities and terms as query score

$\Longrightarrow$ only meets R-Holistic 

No discrimination, not aware of uncertainty and conceptual patterns and lack validation layer.

* EntityRank - concrete design

Add a vitual observer operates samely over a randomized D

Three layers: access layer, recognition layer and newly-added validation layer

- access layer ::
calculate p(d) adopting PageRank and aggregate for a tuple $t$ over all the pages $d_i$ it occurs, with each weighted by $p(d_i)$

Discrimination can also be captured in this layer

- recognition layer ::
obtain the observed probability $p_o$ taking the maximum probability among all the object occurance (different entity/keywords combination) as $p(q(t)|d)$

then two consideration are involved:
  + Extraction uncertainty --- generated during entity extraction over the corpus and recorded in $e_i.conf$
  + Association context --- how $t$ matches $q$ in the context of $d$? p_context
    
    p_context is the product of booean pattern constraint $\alpha_B$ (fit or not, 1 or 0), and proximity function $\alpha_P$ with a proposed span proximity model in the system

    span proximity model: define span as the shortest window that covers the entire entity occurance, whose length is denoted as $s$, and a object occurance $\gamma$
    $$\alpha_P(\gamma) = p(\gamma |s) = p(s|\gamma)$$
    where we assume the prior probabilities $p(\gamma)$ and $p(s)$ are all the same

patterns and span proximity model are some reasonable implementations, more sophisticated ones can also be adopted. /(discriminative model -- [11])/

- validation layer ::
validate with the null hypothesis (the same operation on a randomized D) generating the randomized probability $p_r$

randomize the dataset while preserving $p(e_i\in d), p(k_i \in d), e_i.conf$

After randomization, conditional probabilities are actually independent. Given different span values are independent, for contextual probability, the average value is used.

Simplefied G-test, given $p_o,p_r << 1$. The higher the score, the more likely they are truly associated. 

$Score(q(t)) \propto p_o\cdot log\frac{p_o}{p_r}$$

- implementation sketch ::

Indexing: standard inverted index, all occurance of each entity type is stored in an ordered list. 

Search: $p_r$ and PR can be done off-line, scalable on ordered-list operations

* System Prototype
** Implementation
engine --- Lemur IR Toolkit and adapted to entity indexing
corpus --- Stanford WebBase Project
entity extraction --- rule-driven (regular patterns /e.g. #phone, #email/) + dictionary-driven (enumerated keywords /e.g. #university, #professor/)

** Qualitative Analysis 
Case studies on four senarios

** Quantitative Evaluation

Compare accuracy with five other approaches

query:
 - top 30 company names in Fortune 500, 2006 with #phone, 
 - 88 PC member name of SIGMOD 2007 with #email.

measure --- mean reciprocal rank (approx 0.65, outperforming all the other approaches)

relatively efficient both temporally (2.45s) and spacially (<0.1% overall overhead)

Elaborate the effectiveness of /global aggregation/, /local analysis/, /discriminative and associative factors/ and /holistic analysis/, respectively.
